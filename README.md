# QuadrotorGNC
These are MATLAB codes developed in Quadrotor Projects.
Run the topSimulateControl file and simulation of quadrotor which hovers around a circular path of 2 meters will run.

a_star2d.cc, depth_first_search2d.cc, dijkstra2d.cc are 2-dimensional path-planning C++ algorithm developed in the class.
